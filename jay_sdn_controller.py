# Instructor: Aniruddha Gokhale
# Student: Jay Barot
# Created: Fall 2022
# 
# This code was create for Programming Assignment 4
# This is my own custom SDN Controller for our PA4 docker network
# I first the information regarding the docker servies I initiated
# By using the python docker SDK. And the associated networks these services are using.
# Then implement Dijkstras algorithm on the network
#
# Nothing is hardcoded, this controller can be used for ANY network with appropriate network data,
# and the Dijkstras algorithm will give the shortest path to each node in the network given the startnode.

# import the needed packages
import argparse # for argument parsing
import docker
import json
import pyfiglet # Just for fun, Good looking banners
